## Set
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.

### Input
```sh
# Different types of sets in Python
# set of integers
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(my_set)

# set of mixed datatypes
my_set = {1.0, "Hello", (1, 2, 3)}
print(my_set)
```
### Output
```sh
{1, 2, 3}
{1.0, (1, 2, 3), 'Hello'}
```
